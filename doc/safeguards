checks for network connection between itself and treadmill software before running perturbation
checks for connection with DAQ before running perturbation
checks for mouse connection before running perturbation
if treadmill movement signal is not received from mouse, after 1.5 seconds, a deceleration signal is sent to the treadmill and a warning window is displayed
Check is performed to make sure that the data in the perturbation table, database, and acceleration/deceleration boxes are in synchrony
All safety critical functions are wrapped in a try/catch block to alert the user of problems
After deceleration is complete, another deceleration signal is sent to make sure that the treadmill has stopped
During perturbations, buttons are greyed out to prevent users from sending additional acceleration signals while a perturbation is being run
Several flags are used to prevent multiple acceleration signals from being sent.
