1. Unit Testing: All methods in each class are individually tested.

2. Integration Testing: Units, that work together, are combined and overall logic is tested.

3. End-to-End Testing: The entire application is tested; includes compilation
   on multiple systems, simulated button clicks and testing all functionality.

4. Code Re-Factoring: Code is cleaned up, variable and function names are made
   consistent, large classes are broken down into smaller and more manageable
   classes, global variables are replaced by local variables with functions
   that modify those variables, remove redundancies with proper design
   patterns.

5. Incorporate EMG into code.

6. Incorporate Stimulus into code.

Note: All testing involves writing code to automate the testing procedure.
This allows for consistant testing.
